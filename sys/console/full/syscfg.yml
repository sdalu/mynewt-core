            When enabled, data are received to intermediate ringbuffer and
            processed in task context instead of interrupt. This prevents
            from possible deadlocking when trying to output large amount of
            data directly from RX handler (e.g. when echoing data back).
            Set to 0 to disable (received data are handled in interrupt context)
